Today I am starting my blog *technical capital*. I have already created an [About](/about) page you can check out. I
will blog about things I find out for myself and then like to share with the Internet. Maybe someone else will find it
also useful.

So what's *technical capital*?

I always strive to write clean code and leave the code cleaner than I found it. In this way I prevent the formation of "technical debt" or try to reduce it if possible. What is the opposite of debt? Yes, now you have it... don't judge me :)

I already have an idea for my actual first blog post (this one is only an introduction), so stay tuned.
